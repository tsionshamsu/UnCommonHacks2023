# TheMadHatterProject --UnCommonHacks2023 

## Inspiration
I think that I've grown older I've come to appreciate children books more and among them Alice in Wonderland has stayed a favorite of mine. Other than the nostalgia that binds me to it, Alice's struggle into adulthood I believe is one that carries with us, where we have to manage a balance between being childish and curious enough to consider ridiculous things but also thoughtful and mature enough to do what is right. I wanted to make this game because I've always loved Alice In Wonderland and it was also a cool way for me to expand my game dev skills.

## What it does
Alice is in Wonderland and there she fights with the red queen's army, her dragon and the red queen herself.

## How I built it
I mainly used java, but also spent time making the sprites which was pretty fun. Here's what I made for Alice and the Red Queen:

## Challenges I ran into
I was using a java library called object draw that simplifies multi-threading in java but I ran into some problems with threads running concurrently so debugging them was weird.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I really like how my game turned out and figuring out some of those bugs definitely gave me some Eureka! moments :)

## What I learned
Although java can be difficult and annoying sometimes, you can do really cool stuff with it.

## What's next for MadHatterProject
More Levels, Harder Enemies, More Settings and loads more imagination.
