# UnCommonHacks2023
Inspiration
I think that I've grown older I've come to appreciate children books more and among them Alice in Wonderland has stayed a favorite of mine. Other than the nostalgia that binds me to it, Alice's struggle into adulthood I believe is one that carries with us, where we have to manage a balance between being childish and curious enough to consider ridiculous things but also thoughtful and mature enough to do what is right. I wanted to make this game because I've always loved Alice In Wonderland and it was also a cool way for me to expand my game dev skills.

What it does
Alice is in Wonderland and there she fights with the red queen's army, her dragon and the red queen herself.

How we built it
I mainly used java, but also spent time making the sprites which was pretty fun.

Challenges we ran into
I was using a java library called object draw that simplifies multi-threading in java but I ran into some problems with threads running concurrently so debugging them was weird.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
I really like how my game turned out and figuring out some of those bugs definitely gave me some Eureka! moments :)

What we learned
Although java can be difficult and annoying sometimes, you can do really cool stuff with it.

What's next for MadHatterProject
More Levels, Harder Enemies, More Settings and loads more imagination.

Built With
